Solution Two: Report Generation with Data Warehouse for Historical Data

This solution enhances reporting efficiency by integrating a Data Warehouse to store historical data, reducing the load on the main operational database. Reports are generated by the SPV2 Application, which retrieves data from both the live database (for recent transactions) and the data warehouse (for historical data). Reports are then saved to a file server and optionally sent to users via email.

Step-by-Step Description of Solution Two

1. User Interaction

Users interact with the SPV2 Application to view and download reports.

Reports are available via direct download or email notifications.



---

2. Database (Operational Data)

The main MS-SQL Server Database handles daily operations.

Contains real-time/live data needed for up-to-date reporting.

Periodic backups are sent to the Data Warehouse.



---

3. Data Warehouse (Historical Data Storage)

Stores historical data to reduce the load on the main database.

Used for long-term analysis and reducing query execution time for reports.

SPV2 fetches historical data from here instead of querying the live database.



---

4. SPV2 Application (Report Processing)

Queries live data from the Operational Database.

Queries historical data from the Data Warehouse.

Generates reports based on user input and saves them to a file server.



---

5. File Server (Report Storage)

Stores generated reports for later access.

Users can download reports directly from here.

Prevents unnecessary reprocessing of reports, improving system efficiency.



---

6. Email System (Automated Report Delivery)

Users can choose to receive reports via email.

The SPV2 Application sends the report file to the Email System.

The Email System delivers the file as an attachment or a download link.

Key Benefits of This Approach

âœ… Performance Optimization â€“ The Data Warehouse reduces the load on the main database by handling historical queries.
âœ… Efficient Report Generation â€“ Reports use both real-time and historical data, ensuring accurate reporting without impacting daily operations.
âœ… Scalable for Growth â€“ The Data Warehouse can be expanded to accommodate larger datasets over time.
âœ… Secure File Storage â€“ Reports are stored on a File Server, reducing the need to regenerate reports multiple times.
âœ… Automated Email Reports â€“ Users receive reports without manually downloading, improving usability.

Final Verdict

This solution optimizes reporting performance by utilizing a Data Warehouse for historical data storage while keeping live data queries efficient. By storing reports on a file server and integrating email notifications, it ensures a smooth and scalable reporting workflow.
