Title: “Pen Test Remediation Summary”
Subtitle (optional): Securing a Legacy Web Application in Response to a Security Assessment

Introduction:

This presentation outlines the key vulnerabilities identified during a recent penetration test of our legacy web application and the corresponding remediation actions taken.

The application, built on Classic ASP and hosted on IIS, had several security gaps common in older systems — including missing security headers, unsafe cookie settings, lack of CSP enforcement, and exposure to client-side risks.

The goal of this remediation was to address each finding without breaking existing functionality, while aligning with modern web security best practices.

In the following slides, you’ll see a breakdown of each vulnerability, the associated risk, and the applied fix — covering both server-level (IIS) and application-level changes.
