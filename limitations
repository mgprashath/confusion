Limitations & Concerns

In the current design, several long-term architectural solutions had to be deprioritized due to existing technical and resource limitations. As a result, the following concerns and trade-offs are noted:
	•	No Access to Data Warehouse: Due to infrastructure constraints, integration with a dedicated data warehouse is not implemented at this stage, limiting advanced analytics and historical trend reporting.
	•	File Server Still Required: Although reports are auto-generated, a centralized file server is still necessary to store and manage the exported CSV/XLSX files, adding dependency on existing file infrastructure.
	•	No NoSQL/File System Server: Plans to introduce a NoSQL or alternative file system for scalable unstructured data handling have been deferred due to current environment limitations.
	•	Live Database Usage: The module relies on the live transactional database, which introduces risks related to query performance and potential database load during high-traffic periods.
	•	Search Functionality Constraints: Advanced search capabilities are limited by current schema and indexing, which may affect filtering performance for large datasets.
	•	Limited Historical Data: The solution only supports up to six months of historical data per client, restricting long-term analysis or year-over-year comparisons.
	•	Database Impact: Although queries are optimized, executing report generation directly on the live SQL database could still impose additional load, potentially impacting the performance of core applications during peak usage times.
