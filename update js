Great — you’re working with an old app that uses PDFObject, and the version is from around 2008. That’s PDFObject v1.x, which is very outdated, lacks proper browser support, and has limitations.

⸻

✅ Your Goal: Upgrade PDF embedding in your app (Classic ASP + JavaScript frontend)

Let’s walk through the upgrade path:

⸻

✅ Step 1: Use the Latest PDFObject (v2.2.8)

PDFObject v2.2.8 is the latest stable version. It supports:
	•	All modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
	•	Graceful fallback when no native PDF support is available
	•	Simpler embedding syntax

Official site:

https://pdfobject.com

Download from:

https://github.com/pipwerks/PDFObject

⸻

✅ Step 2: Replace Old Script Include

In your old app you might see something like:

<script type="text/javascript" src="pdfobject.js"></script>

Replace it with the latest version:

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdfobject/2.2.8/pdfobject.min.js"></script>

Or download the latest pdfobject.min.js and include it locally.

⸻

✅ Step 3: Replace Old Embedding Code

Old version likely uses:

PDFObject.embed("myfile.pdf", "pdfContainer");

That syntax is still supported in v2.2.8, but now you can add extra options like height, fallback, etc.

Modern example:

<div id="pdfContainer"></div>

<script>
    PDFObject.embed("myfile.pdf", "#pdfContainer", {
        height: "600px"
    });
</script>



⸻

✅ Step 4: Handle Fallback for Unsupported Browsers

The new version gives better fallback support. You can write:

<noscript>
    <p>This document requires JavaScript and a browser with PDF support.</p>
</noscript>

Or let the library handle it via CSS.

⸻

✅ Step 5: (Optional) Make it Dynamic

If your Classic ASP app is dynamically generating PDF links:

<%
pdfUrl = "pdfs/" & Request.QueryString("doc") & ".pdf"
%>
<script>
    PDFObject.embed("<%=pdfUrl%>", "#pdfContainer", { height: "600px" });
</script>

Just make sure the PDF file exists and is accessible.

⸻

✅ Summary

Task	Done with
Upgrade script	pdfobject.min.js v2.2.8
Drop-in replacement	PDFObject.embed(...)
More options/fallback	Supported in v2.2.8
Compatible with Classic ASP	✅ Yes (just update the frontend)

Let me know if you want help writing a dynamic viewer page, fallback to download, or even switching to <iframe> or <embed> for more control.
