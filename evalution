Here’s a point-form description of the existing system technology (Classic ASP), its limitations as a legacy system, and a comparison table showing the evolution of Microsoft’s web technology stack (Classic ASP to ASP.NET Core), including support status:

⸻

Existing System Overview (Classic ASP)
	•	Built on Classic ASP (Active Server Pages).
	•	Scripting language: VBScript or JScript.
	•	Server-side rendering through .asp files.
	•	Relies on COM components and ADO for database interaction.
	•	Limited separation of concerns (HTML and logic are tightly coupled).
	•	Runs on IIS (Internet Information Services).
	•	No built-in support for modern practices like:
	•	MVC (Model-View-Controller)
	•	Dependency Injection
	•	Strong security headers
	•	Scripts are interpreted, not compiled — lower performance.
	•	Difficult to maintain and extend for modern web needs.

⸻

Why Classic ASP is a Legacy/Deprecated System
	•	Outdated technology: Released in 1996, replaced by ASP.NET in 2002.
	•	No longer actively developed by Microsoft.
	•	Security limitations: No modern defenses like anti-XSS or CSRF protections.
	•	Poor scalability for modern, component-based architecture.
	•	Minimal IDE support (e.g., no IntelliSense, debugging tools).
	•	Lack of community support and packages.
	•	No official cross-platform support (Windows/IIS only).
	•	Security risks increase over time without updates.

Microsoft Web Technology Evolution and Support Table

Technology	Released	Current Status	End of Support	Modern Replacement
Classic ASP	1996	Legacy/Deprecated	No support roadmap; only maintained for backwards compatibility in IIS	ASP.NET / ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET WebForms	2002	Legacy	Part of .NET Framework; no active innovation	ASP.NET MVC / Razor Pages
ASP.NET MVC	2009	Maintenance only	.NET Framework 4.8 support ends in 2029	ASP.NET Core MVC
ASP.NET Core	2016	Fully supported	Active development with .NET 8 LTS	Current best practice

Key Takeaway Slide Message

The existing platform is built using Classic ASP, a 1990s-era scripting framework that lacks support for modern development, security, and performance needs. It is officially legacy and poses maintainability and risk concerns. Migration to ASP.NET Core is highly recommended.
