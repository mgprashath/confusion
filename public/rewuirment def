Here’s a clear and concise requirement definition you can include in your presentation — addressing the need to resolve vulnerabilities immediately while planning a future migration to modern technologies. This aligns with your pen test report findings and current situation.

Requirement Definition & Remediation Strategy

Background
	•	The current application is built using Classic ASP, a legacy Microsoft technology.
	•	A recent penetration test has identified multiple critical and medium vulnerabilities including:
	•	Sensitive data exposure via GET requests
	•	Missing HttpOnly cookie flags
	•	Outdated security headers
	•	Inline scripts and styles violating CSP (Content Security Policy)
	•	Vulnerable server enumeration (IIS short name)
	•	Deprecated platform dependencies

Immediate Objectives (Short-Term)
	•	Mitigate high-risk vulnerabilities within the existing Classic ASP system:
	•	Refactor inline JavaScript and CSS into external files
	•	Implement secure HTTP headers via web server configuration (IIS)
	•	Enforce secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure)
	•	Replace GET methods with POST for sensitive data
	•	Disable IIS features vulnerable to enumeration
	•	Ensure compliance with internal security policies and penetration testing requirements
	•	Avoid service disruption during peak operational use

Why Maintain the Existing System Temporarily
	•	The current platform is business-critical and in active use.
	•	A full rebuild or migration requires significant planning, resourcing, and testing.
	•	Many dependencies are tightly coupled to Classic ASP (e.g., legacy COM, VBScript logic).
	•	Minimizing risk while securing what’s already in production is cost-effective in the short term.

Long-Term Objectives (Future Plan)
	•	Plan phased migration to ASP.NET Core (or modern tech stack):
	•	Modular rebuild based on user flows (Step 1–Step 3)
	•	RESTful APIs to separate logic from presentation
	•	Strong authentication, authorization, and secure session handling
	•	Adopt CI/CD, automated testing, and DevSecOps practices
	•	Deliver a scalable, secure, and maintainable solution with long-term support
