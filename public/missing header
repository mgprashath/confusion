Here’s a short recommendation you can add to your slide to explain the missing HTTP security headers shown in the image:

Recommendation:

To strengthen response security and reduce the risk of attacks such as clickjacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), and data exposure:
	•	Remove “X-Powered-By” header to prevent disclosing technology stack (e.g., ASP.NET version).
	•	Add the following HTTP response headers in the server configuration (web.config for IIS):
	•	X-Frame-Options: DENY – Prevents clickjacking by disallowing the site to be embedded in an iframe.
	•	Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload – Forces HTTPS and helps prevent protocol downgrade attacks.
	•	Referrer-Policy: no-referrer – Prevents leaking referrer info to external sites.
	•	X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff – Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type.
	•	Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate – Disables browser and proxy caching of sensitive content.
	•	Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' – Limits where content (e.g., scripts) can be loaded from, mitigating XSS attacks.

These headers are now configured and validated in the latest server patch to address “Missing Application Security Headers” vulnerability from the recent penetration test.
