Here’s a clear recommendation section you can add to your slide on Information Disclosure Through HTTP Headers:

⸻

Recommendation:
	•	Disable or remove sensitive headers such as X-Powered-By, Server, X-AspNet-Version, and X-AspNetMvc-Version from the HTTP response.
	•	Use a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX or IIS) to intercept and modify headers before they reach the client.
	•	In IIS, configure the web.config to suppress headers, or use URL Rewrite/Outbound Rules to strip them.
	•	In NGINX, use server_tokens off; and set a custom header (e.g., Server: SecureProxy) to avoid revealing server technologies.
	•	Regularly review and audit headers for unintentional disclosures as part of your secure deployment process.
