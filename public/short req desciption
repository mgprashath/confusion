You’re absolutely right — that’s more suited for notes or a document. Here’s a condensed version perfect for a presentation slide:

Requirement Definition & Remediation Strategy

Current System:
	•	Built on legacy Classic ASP
	•	Technology is deprecated, limited Microsoft support
	•	Penetration testing found critical security issues

Immediate Needs:
	•	Fix vulnerabilities in the current system (e.g., CSP violations, insecure cookies, sensitive GET requests)
	•	Apply secure headers and server hardening
	•	Maintain service continuity

Why Stay on Classic ASP (for now):
	•	Business-critical system in active use
	•	Migration requires time, budget, and coordination
	•	Short-term fixes reduce risk without disruption

Future Plan:
	•	Gradual migration to modern ASP.NET Core or equivalent
	•	Adopt secure coding practices and modern architecture
	•	Improve long-term maintainability and security

This version is presentation-ready. Let me know if you’d like it turned into a slide layout or if you’d prefer a visual (like a timeline or table).
