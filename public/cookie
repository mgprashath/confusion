Here’s a clear and concise recommendation you can add to your slide for “Cookie Without HttpOnly Flag Set”:

⸻

Recommendation:
	•	Configure cookies with the HttpOnly attribute to prevent client-side access via JavaScript.
	•	Set the Secure flag to ensure cookies are transmitted only over HTTPS.
	•	Use a reverse proxy (e.g., IIS, NGINX) to enforce security headers at the server level.
	•	Review application code and third-party libraries to ensure cookies are not set without flags.
	•	Regularly test cookie configurations as part of your security testing lifecycle.
