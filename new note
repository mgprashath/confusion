Sure! Let’s refine your Proposed System Design text and provide a clear point-by-point explanation of the system flow based on the diagram.

Updated Proposed System Design

After several discussions and considering current infrastructure limitations, the initial phase of the solution will query data directly from the live transactional database.
	•	Search functionalities will be limited to minimize performance impact on the live database.
	•	Business consultation is required to define acceptable levels of access and filtering logic.

This approach is designed to provide essential reporting capabilities while balancing system performance and security. Report files will be stored temporarily on a shared file system and made available via the SPV2 application for external users. Internal users will interact via the Q&O interface, with email alerts sent for completed reports.

System Diagram - Point-by-Point Explanation
	1.	Internal User
	•	Initiates report generation from within the Q&O Application (Quote and Order System).
	•	Selects client, table, columns, and date filters using the interactive UI.
	2.	Q&O Application (Software System)
	•	Communicates with the Q and O Database to fetch required data.
	•	Generates the requested report based on client-specific access rights and template settings.
	•	Sends the generated report to the File System for storage.
	•	Saves metadata (such as report details, client, template used) in the Q&O database.
	3.	Q and O Database
	•	Acts as the live data source for report queries.
	•	Stores metadata about generated reports and templates.
	•	Serves as the central system for both internal and external operations.
	4.	File System (File Server)
	•	Temporary storage for generated reports (CSV/XLSX).
	•	Enables retrieval of reports by the SPV2 Application.
	•	Shared resource using Microsoft Exchange/email-compatible infrastructure.
	5.	SPV2 Application (Software System)
	•	Provides report links and associated template details to External Users.
	•	Ensures users only see and download reports for their respective clients.
	•	Retrieves the physical files from the file server on request.
	6.	External User
	•	Downloads finalized reports via the SPV2 application interface.
	•	No access to the live database, ensuring secure and filtered delivery of data.
	7.	Email System (Software System)
	•	Sends notifications and alerts when report generation is complete.
	•	Powered by Microsoft Exchange (or equivalent email infrastructure).
	•	Notifies both internal users (status updates) and external users (download availability).
