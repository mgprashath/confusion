Step-by-Step Description of Solution Two

This solution enhances the reporting architecture by introducing a Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanism to keep the Reporting Database up to date in near real-time. This approach improves performance, scalability, and data consistency while reducing the load on the operational database.


1. User Interaction
	•	Users interact with the SPV2 Application to request, view, and download reports.
	•	Reports are generated using data from the Reporting Database instead of querying the main operational database directly.


2. Operational Database (MS-SQL Server)
	•	The primary database supports daily business operations.
	•	Instead of running heavy queries on this database, the system captures only the latest changes and transfers them to the Reporting Database.



3. Change Data Capture (CDC) Mechanism
	•	The system captures only changes from the operational database using Debezium CDC Tool.
	•	This eliminates the need for full data synchronization, reducing latency and system overhead.
	•	Debezium continuously streams changes, ensuring that the Reporting Database stays up to date without batch delays.


4. Reporting Database (NoSQL)
	•	A NoSQL database stores reporting data for optimized read performance.
	•	The CDC process applies changes to ensure the Reporting Database is continuously updated.
	•	The SPV2 Application queries the Reporting Database instead of the main database, improving system efficiency.

5. SPV2 Application (Report Querying)
	•	The SPV2 Application fetches data from the Reporting Database when generating reports.
	•	Users receive real-time or near real-time reports without affecting operational performance.

Key Benefits of This Approach

✅ Near Real-Time Data Sync – CDC ensures that the Reporting Database is always updated without relying on periodic batch jobs.
✅ Lower Load on Main Database – Reporting queries are offloaded to the NoSQL database, preventing slowdowns in daily operations.
✅ Scalability – The NoSQL database handles large volumes of reporting data, improving query speed.
✅ Better User Experience – Users get faster report generation without delays caused by traditional batch processing.



Step-by-Step Description of Solution One

This solution follows a structured reporting architecture where reports are generated based on live and historical data while ensuring efficient storage and automated distribution. By separating report processing, storage, and delivery, this approach enhances performance, security, and usability without impacting the main operational database.
