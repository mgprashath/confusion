Dear [Manager’s Name / Team],

This is in continuation of our discussion on the 15th of April during the Teams meeting.

I have done everything I could from my side to negotiate with the landlord and letting agent to minimise the financial impact. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts, the negotiation was not successful. I’ve been informed that I am required to pay rent and utility charges in full up to the agreed tenancy termination date.

I am attaching the full email conversation and the final response I received from the agent, which confirms the decision and my financial obligations.

As agreed during the meeting, I expect a reimbursement of this extra amount, which I am now required to settle solely due to the limited and insufficient notice period given for the closure of my onsite assignment. I will share the final invoice once received.

This situation has been a difficult but important lesson in how vulnerable employees can be in such transitions, and the importance of timely and fair support when it is needed most.

Regards,
Prashath Karunasiri
