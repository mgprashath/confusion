Dear [Manager’s Name / Team],

I’m writing to express my deep disappointment regarding the way my onsite closure has been handled.

Despite my efforts, I’ve had to bear significant stress—both financially and emotionally—just to negotiate an early tenancy end. I remain liable for rent and utilities even after being asked to leave the UK on short notice, with limited support from the team. I was also repeatedly pushed to raise a TMS request without any written confirmation, and urged not to involve higher management—leaving me feeling pressured rather than supported.

I’ve attached the email exchange and the agent’s letter to show what I’ve had to manage alone. As part of the resolution reached during our recent call, I will forward the invoice for the agreed reimbursement as soon as I receive it from the landlord.

This experience is a difficult but important lesson for employees like us in understanding how to make informed choices moving forward.

Regards,
Prashath Karunasiri
