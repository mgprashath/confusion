Here’s a summary of the 7 vulnerabilities shown in your image, which you can include as slide content for your presentation. Each entry includes a title, explanation, risk, and suggested remediation:

⸻

1. Sensitive Information Sent via GET Request
	•	Description: Sensitive data like usernames, passwords, or tokens are sent through URLs using the HTTP GET method.
	•	Risk: URLs are often logged in browser history, server logs, and third-party tools—leading to potential data leaks.
	•	Remediation: Use the POST method for transmitting sensitive information, and encrypt the data using HTTPS.

⸻

2. Cookie Without HttpOnly Flag Set
	•	Description: Cookies lack the HttpOnly attribute, making them accessible via JavaScript.
	•	Risk: Increases the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, as malicious scripts can steal session cookies.
	•	Remediation: Set the HttpOnly flag for cookies that do not require access from JavaScript to protect against theft.

⸻

3. Information Disclosure Through HTTP Headers
	•	Description: Web servers or applications expose sensitive details like software version, server type, or framework in headers.
	•	Risk: Helps attackers fingerprint systems and exploit known vulnerabilities.
	•	Remediation: Configure the web server to suppress or sanitize HTTP headers, such as X-Powered-By, Server, and X-AspNet-Version.

⸻

4. Missing Application Security Headers
	•	Description: Headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, or X-XSS-Protection are not set.
	•	Risk: Leaves applications open to XSS, clickjacking, and other browser-based attacks.
	•	Remediation: Add appropriate security headers to all responses. Examples include:
	•	Strict-Transport-Security
	•	Content-Security-Policy
	•	X-Content-Type-Options

⸻

5. IIS Short Name Enumeration
	•	Description: IIS servers respond differently when a request uses 8.3 short file names (e.g., test~1.aspx).
	•	Risk: Attackers can enumerate files or folders and use this info for further exploitation.
	•	Remediation: Disable short file name generation on NTFS:

fsutil behavior set disable8dot3 1

And block suspicious requests via web.config or firewall rules.

⸻

6. Outdated and Deprecated Software Detected
	•	Description: The server is running software that is no longer supported or hasn’t been updated.
	•	Risk: Known vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers.
	•	Remediation: Regularly patch and update server software, frameworks, libraries, and components.

⸻

7. Missing DNS Security Records
	•	Description: DNS lacks records like DNSSEC, SPF, DKIM, or DMARC.
	•	Risk: Vulnerable to DNS spoofing, email spoofing, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
	•	Remediation:
	•	Enable DNSSEC to protect integrity.
	•	Add SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to secure email communication.
